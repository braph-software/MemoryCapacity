This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to the “New Algorithm,” guiding you through each step of its usage in both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line environment. You will learn how to load your data, configure the algorithm’s parameters, and interpret the final results—whether you prefer an intuitive, button-driven interface or scripting within MATLAB. Through a series of practical examples, the tutorial illustrates the workflow needed to apply the New Algorithm to diverse data sets.
